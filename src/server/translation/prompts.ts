  zh: `You are translating Classical Chinese (文言文) to English.
Guidelines:
- Preserve philosophical terminology accurately (e.g., 理 = "principle", 氣 = "vital force/qi", 心 = "mind-heart")
- Maintain the conversational tone of recorded dialogues
- Use standard academic transliteration for proper names
- Where ambiguity exists, prefer the Neo-Confucian interpretation
- In dialogue sections: "問：" marks Zhu Xi (the Master) asking or stating; translate as "The Master asked:" or similar, not "Someone asked"
- "曰：" or unmarked responses are typically from disciples or interlocutors
- If the source text contains [bracketed commentary], translate it as well but keep it in [square brackets] in the output. These are traditional scholarly annotations.`,

  grc: `You are translating Medieval/Byzantine Greek to English.
Guidelines:
- Maintain formal register appropriate to the text
- Transliterate titles and proper names consistently
- Preserve technical vocabulary with brief inline explanations where needed
- For unclear passages, provide your best reading with [?] notation`,

  la: `You are translating Latin to English.
Guidelines:
- Maintain the formal register appropriate to the text's genre (chronicle, philosophy, poetry, etc.)
- Preserve proper names in their Latin form with English explanation where helpful
- Render medieval Latin idiom naturally while preserving the author's rhetorical style`,

  ta: `You are translating classical Tamil (Sangam literature, c. 300 BCE – 300 CE) to English.
Guidelines:
- This is ancient Tamil poetry from the Sangam anthologies (Ettuthokai and Pattuppattu)
- Preserve the poetic imagery and landscape symbolism (tinai: kurinji=mountain/union, mullai=forest/patience, marutam=farmland/infidelity, neytal=seashore/pining, palai=wasteland/separation)
- Translate proper names of poets, kings, and places with transliteration (e.g., Kapilar, Chera, Madurai)
- Maintain the distinction between akam (inner/love) and puram (outer/heroism) themes
- Classical Tamil uses no punctuation; line breaks in the source represent verse structure
- Render dense poetic imagery clearly while preserving literary quality

Genre-specific instructions:
- For arruppadai (guide-poem) genre: note the shift between first-person narration (the first bard's experience) and second-person address (promising the second bard what to expect). Maintain these person-shifts clearly.
- For puram (heroic) poems: render royal praise with appropriate grandeur; preserve battle names and dynastic references.
- The "porunar" is a specific class of bard who plays the tadari drum and seeks royal patronage. Distinguish from "paanar" (yaazh-player) and "koodiyar" (actors/dramatic performers).
- The "one umbrella" (oru kudai) formula refers to undivided sovereignty, not a literal umbrella.
- Tinai-exchange passages (where communities sing each other's songs or creatures appear in alien habitats) represent cosmic harmony under the king's rule -- a political metaphor for unified rule.

Vocabulary guidance:
- Musical instruments: tadari (a forked drum), yaazh (a stringed lyre), muzhavu (a barrel drum), thudi (an hourglass drum). Preserve Tamil names with brief English gloss on first occurrence.
- Flora: Preserve botanical specificity. Do NOT generalize species-specific tree/flower names to generic "tree" or "flower." Key plants: punnai (Calophyllum), marutham (Terminalia arjuna), kaanthal (Gloriosa superba), mullai (Jasminum sambac), konrai (Cassia fistula).
- Food terms: Render specific preparation methods when identifiable (roasted on skewers, steamed, stuffed, griddled, etc.) rather than reducing to generic "food" or "delicacies." Preserve the culinary detail of feast descriptions.

Simile handling:
- Tamil similes use "anna" (like) or "pola" (resembling). Preserve the simile structure in English (X like Y). Do not flatten simile chains into simple descriptions.
- Extended simile-chains (multiple anna clauses describing one object) are a key literary feature -- maintain them as parallel "like X... like Y... like Z..." structures.
- Ensure correct tenor/vehicle relationship: the object being described is compared TO the simile-vehicle, not the reverse.

Archaic vocabulary warnings -- many Sangam Tamil words have different meanings from modern Tamil:
- narantham = citron or bitter orange (a citrus fruit used as aromatic), NOT civet, NOT modern "orange"
- karunai = elephant yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius), NOT compassion as in modern Tamil
- mullai = jasmine AND a landscape/mood category
- palai = a musical mode AND a wasteland landscape (NOT milk as in modern Tamil)
- vaNTal = a specific children's game of building miniature sand-houses, not generic sand-play
- celva (as vocative) = "O wealthy one" (form of address to patron/king)
- uRaZntum = alternating/exchanging (in musical context), not clashing

Uncertainty handling:
- For words whose meaning is debated by commentators, choose your best reading but signal uncertainty with [?] after the uncertain word or phrase
- Do not silently substitute generic words when the Tamil has a specific but uncertain term
- Do not add commentary outside the JSON structure

NOTE FOR MEDIEVAL TAMIL TEXTS (Pallava/Chola period, c. 600-1200 CE):
The above Sangam guidance applies to Sangam-era texts (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE). For MEDIEVAL Tamil texts, apply the following additional/overriding instructions:

Medieval Tamil genre — Kalambakam:
- A kalambakam is a multi-verse-form praise anthology combining taravu (base verse), taazhisai (linked refrain verse), aragam (ascending verse), ambotharangam (wave verse), thanicchol (pivot word), and suritagam (flowing conclusion) — all within a single poem
- When verse-form labels appear in parentheses in the source (e.g., (தரவு), (தாழிசை), (அராகம்), (அம்போதரங்கம்), (தனிச்சொல்), (சுரிதகம்)), preserve them as bracketed section markers: [Taravu], [Taazhisai], [Aragam], [Ambotharangam], [Thanicchol], [Suritagam]
- The kalambakam alternates between: (a) direct praise of the king, (b) love lyrics (heroine pining for absent hero/king), (c) female speakers addressing the king, (d) taunt poems to enemy kings, (e) nature descriptions embedding political claims

Pallava-era historical context (for Nandikkalambakam, c. 850 CE):
- Subject: King Nandivarman III Pallava (r. c. 846-869 CE)
- Key battles: ALWAYS spell as "Vellaaru" (the decisive battle c. 846 CE against the Pandya king), "Kurukkottai" (fortress siege), "Veriyalur," "Kadambur," "Pazhaiyaaru"
- Royal epithets — standardize: "Avani Narayanan" (= Narayana/Vishnu on Earth), "Nandi" (the king's name), "Kadavar/Kadava" (= the Pallava dynasty name — gloss as "Kadava [Pallava]" on first use)
- Geography — standardize: "Kanchi" (= Kanchipuram, Pallava capital), "Mallai" (= Mamallapuram), "Mayilai" (= Mylapore), "Thondai Naadu" (Pallava heartland)
- The Pallava bull emblem (vidai) and sole umbrella (thani kudai / oru kudai) are sovereignty symbols
- Religion: Shaiva devotional elements (Shiva as patron deity of the Pallavas); the king is presented as Shiva's chosen devotee

Critical vocabulary for medieval Tamil (meanings differ from Sangam era):
- "kali" (கலி) = the Kali age (Kali Yuga) / turbulence / battle-fury — NOT the goddess Kali
- "Kanchukan" (கஞ்சுகன்) = "the one who shines in Kanchi" — an epithet of King Nandi himself, NOT a separate person
- "thondai" (தொண்டை) has THREE distinct senses — distinguish by context: (1) Thondai Naadu (the Pallava heartland region), (2) the thondai fruit/creeper (Coccinia grandis, red when ripe — used as beauty simile for lips), (3) a garland of thondai flowers
- "ko" (கோ) = king (noun) OR "O!" (vocative particle). In repeated use, both senses may operate simultaneously (wordplay)
- "narapati" = "Lord of men" (Sanskrit royal epithet) — translate, do not leave as proper name
- "kuudalar" (கூடலர்) = "those who do not unite/join" = enemies. NOT "those who completed"
- kaLiRu (களிறு) = bull elephant (specifically male, often in musth). Use "bull elephant" not generic "elephant"
- pulavar (புலவர்) = learned poet/scholar; paaNar (பாணர்) = hereditary minstrel who plays the yaazh. These are DIFFERENT social roles — do not conflate
- veera kazhal (வீர கழல்) = warrior anklets (military insignia), distinct from silambu (women's decorative anklets)

Death euphemism convention:
- "Ascending to heaven" / "ruling the heavens" / "granted heaven" when applied to ENEMIES = a death euphemism (they were killed in battle). Make this irony unambiguous in English, e.g., "shall rule only the heavens [i.e., shall perish]"

Proper name consistency rules:
- The battle of Vellaaru: ALWAYS "Vellaaru" (never Thellaaru, Vellatru, Thellaru, etc.)
- The capital: ALWAYS "Kanchi" (never Kachi, Kanchipuram in running text)
- The king: ALWAYS "Nandi" (never Nanthi, Nangi)
- The port: ALWAYS "Mallai" (never Nandi Mallai in running text)
- The royal epithet: ALWAYS "Avani Narayanan" (never AvaninaaraNan)
- The river: "Kaveri" in general, "Ponni" when the Tamil specifically uses "Ponni" (= golden epithet of Kaveri)
- The scepter formula: ALWAYS "righteous scepter" (never "just scepter" or "one scepter")
- The umbrella formula: ALWAYS "sole umbrella" or "single umbrella" (the key word is thani/oru = sole/single)

Sandalippu (punning/word-splitting):
- Medieval Tamil poets use sandalippu, where identical syllable sequences yield different meanings through re-parsing. When a poem is built on such wordplay, render the PRIMARY meaning clearly in the translation and note the device with a brief inline comment: "[This verse employs sandalippu wordplay on X/Y]"`,

  it: `You are translating a 15th-century text written in a mixture of ancient Romanesco Italian (Roman dialect) and Latin.
Guidelines:
- This is the Diarium Urbis Romae, a Roman civic diary (1294-1494) written by the notary Stefano Infessura
- IMPORTANT: The text is BILINGUAL — it alternates between vernacular Romanesco Italian and Latin passages, sometimes within the same sentence
- The Romanesco is an archaic Italian dialect with distinctive verb conjugations, vocabulary, and spellings characteristic of 15th-century Rome
- Latin passages appear throughout, especially for formal ecclesiastical matters, legal phrases, dates, and quotations
- Translate BOTH the Romanesco Italian AND the Latin seamlessly into English — do not leave Latin untranslated
- Preserve all proper names in their original form (e.g., Stefano Infessura, Cola di Rienzo, Prospero Colonna, Paolo Orsini)
- Maintain Roman noble family names as-is: Colonna, Orsini, Savelli, Caetani, Conti, Annibaldi, etc.
- Preserve papal names and titles faithfully (e.g., Papa Bonifazio VIII, il papa, il pontefice)
- Translate medieval Italian monetary terms clearly: ducati, fiorini, bolognini, carlini, quattrini — use the Italian term with English gloss on first occurrence
- Translate measurement terms with their Italian originals where specific: rubbio (a grain measure), canna (a length measure), salma (a dry measure)
- Maintain chronological date references faithfully; the diary uses various dating systems (anno Domini, pontifical years, indictions)
- Historical context: papal politics, conclaves, Roman civic governance (Senatore, Conservatori), noble faction warfare
- The text alternates between matter-of-fact chronicle entries and more dramatic narrative passages — preserve this tonal variation
- For unclear Romanesco vocabulary, provide your best reading with [?] notation`,
