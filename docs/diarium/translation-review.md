## Sample Paragraphs Examined

### Sample 1: Chapter 1, Paragraph 2 (Mixed Latin phrase with prophecy)

**Source (Romanesco + Latin):**
> la campana di Anagni sonava a stuormo. lo conte Romano di casa Ursina veniva con gente, mandato dallo re Roberto che lo papa venisse a Roma, donne li cittadini da Anagna gridavano: «mora li forastieri »; et fuoro cacciati da Anagni li Colomiesi et in tre dy venne lo papa a Roma, et li cittadini romani gridavano pace et lo papa respuse: « pace et sanitate ve tolla Iddio ». et entrò in Santo Pietro. Napolione di Castiello, lo cognato de Sciarra, lo papa lo invitò a pranzo et domannollo se sapeva dove era Sciarra: « lo quale me ha detto: soreta è prenna». et Napolione rispuse e disse: « tanti ragazzi sono in casa, che l' haveranno potuta impren- nare, ma hora mai saria tempo di perdonare alli Colonnesi». e lo papa li disse che non voleva. Napolione li disse: «te bisogna di fare, et non partirai di qui», lo papa addolorato scrisse una lettera allo re Carlo che lo cavasse de Roma, che voleva far peggio alli Ursini che alli Colonnesi, et la lettra venne in mano a Napolione, et raddoppialo le guardie, et quando lo papa lo seppe, dette tanto lo capo allo muro, mordennose le mano, che così addolorato visse tre di. et così finì la sua profetia, cioè: **« intrabit ut vulpis, regnabit ut leo, morietur ut canis »**. la morte soa fu alli 8 d'ottobre, et iace in S. Pietro in quella cappella ferrata a' piedi della chiesa; et regnò otto anni nello papato.

**Translation:**
> the bell of Anagni was sounding the alarm. Count Romano of the Orsini house was coming with men, sent by King Robert so that the pope would come to Rome, and the citizens of Anagni were shouting: 'death to the foreigners'; and the Colonna men were driven out from Anagni and in three days the pope came to Rome, and the Roman citizens were shouting 'peace' and the pope replied: 'may God grant you peace and health'. And he entered Saint Peter's. Napoleone di Castello, Sciarra's brother-in-law, the pope invited him to dinner and asked him if he knew where Sciarra was: 'who said to me: your sister is pregnant'. And Napoleone answered and said: 'there are so many boys in the house, that they could have gotten her pregnant, but now it would be time to pardon the Colonnas'. And the pope told him that he did not want to. Napoleone told him: 'you must do it, and you will not leave here', the pope, distressed, wrote a letter to King Charles to get him out of Rome, because he wanted to do worse to the Orsinis than to the Colonnas, and the letter came into Napoleone's hands, and he doubled the guards, and when the pope learned of it, he banged his head against the wall so much, biting his hands, that he lived in such distress for three days. And thus ended his prophecy, that is: **'he will enter like a fox, reign like a lion, die like a dog'**. His death was on the 8th of October, and he lies in St. Peter's in that iron chapel at the foot of the church; and he reigned eight years in the papacy.

**Assessment:**
- **Latin phrase translated:** YES - "intrabit ut vulpis, regnabit ut leo, morietur ut canis" correctly rendered as "he will enter like a fox, reign like a lion, die like a dog"
- **Romanesco accuracy:** EXCELLENT
  - "donne" (= donde/therefore, actually "where" in context) rendered contextually
  - "soreta è prenna" (= your sister is pregnant) correctly translated
  - "mordennose le mano" (= biting his hands) correctly rendered
- **Names preserved:** YES - Orsini, Colonna, Napoleone, Sciarra all correct
- **Minor issue:** "donne" is rendered as "and" but actually means "where" - the citizens of Anagni were shouting. This is a minor contextual interpretation.

### Sample 2: Chapter 1, Paragraph 3 (Latin phrase "fuit Benedictus XI")

**Source:**
> Dopo seguitò un altro papa che fu fatto a Peroscia, lo quale fu attossicato da uno suo cameriere 'n uno fico, perchè li haveva promesso di farlo cardinale e noi fece; lo quale papa era frate predicatore, et durò nel papato otto mesi **et fuit Benedictus XI**

**Translation:**
> Afterwards followed another pope who was made at Perugia, who was poisoned by one of his chamberlains in a fig, because he had promised to make him a cardinal and did not do it; which pope was a Dominican friar, and he lasted in the papacy eight months and **he was Benedict XI**.

**Assessment:**
- **Latin translated:** YES - "et fuit Benedictus XI" correctly rendered as "and he was Benedict XI"
- **Romanesco accuracy:** EXCELLENT
  - "attossicato" (poisoned) correct
  - "'n uno fico" (in a fig) correct

**Translation:**
> In the said year 1407, **on November 7th**, a Saturday, Pope Innocent VII died, and after the funeral rites were performed, the cardinals entered the conclave in the Palace of Saint Peter **on November 14th**, and they remained in the conclave until the first day of December.

**Source:**
> Nell'anno 1361 del mese di agosto, a di 21 de giovedì, hora di nona, li mastri saliere nello tetto di Santo Ianni per racconciare certe tevole di piombo, et nell' hora dello **vespero**, quando li canonici dicevano **magnificat**, vedde uno de essi canonici abbrusciare una tavola et subito gridò allo fuoco...

**Translation:**

**Assessment:**
- **Latin terms:** "vespero" correctly rendered as "vespers"; "magnificat" appropriately kept as "Magnificat" (as a proper liturgical term, this is correct usage)

### Sample 5: Chapter 4, Paragraph 0 (Romanesco dialectal forms)

**Source:**
> EL 1378 nel mese di luglio a. óì 16 vennero Bertoni a ponte Salaro et fecero granne occiditoria de Romani in quello loco; li quaU Bertoni vennero a petitione delli cardinali, che stavano in Anagni, et lo papa stava a Tivoli, et fu papa Urbano VI. dopoi revenne lo papa a Roma et stettece fino ad maio; et lo di di santo Agnilo li Romani hebbero la vittoria et tutti li Bertoni fuoro morti et ribellaose lo Castiello et li Romani refecero le bastie dello mese de novembre fino all'ultimo d'aprile, et sì lo habbero et tanto lo desfecero, **che a tiempo depoi ce givano le crape a pascere**.

**Translation:**
> In 1378, in the month of July, on the 16th, the Bretons came to the Ponte Salario and made a great slaughter of the Romans in that place; these Bretons came at the petition of the cardinals, who were in Anagni, and the pope was in Tivoli, and it was Pope Urban VI. Afterwards the pope returned to Rome and stayed there until May; and on the day of Saint Angelo the Romans had the victory and all the Bretons were killed and the Castle rebelled and the Romans rebuilt the bastions from the month of November until the end of April, and thus they had it and so destroyed it, **that afterwards in time goats went there to graze**.

**Assessment:**
- **Dialectal forms:** EXCELLENT
  - "Bertoni" correctly identified as "Bretons" (Breton mercenaries)
  - "crape" (Romanesco for capre/goats) correctly translated
  - "occiditoria" (massacre/slaughter) correctly rendered
  - "granne" (grande) correctly understood
- **Idiomatic expression:** "che a tiempo depoi ce givano le crape a pascere" brilliantly translated - capturing the vivid imagery of complete destruction

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues (Do Not Affect Overall Quality)

1. **Chapter 1, index 2:** "donne" translated as contextual connector rather than literal "where" - acceptable interpretation but slightly imprecise.

2. **Chapter 12, index 7:** Some OCR artifacts in source ("Eccard [?]", "COR two four S V") appear to have been handled awkwardly, but this is a source text issue, not a translation issue.

3. **Chapter 35, index 0:** The parenthetical scholarly apparatus ("(J>", "C", "M") is sometimes included in translation output - this is source text cleanup issue, not translation quality.

### No Major Issues Found

- No Latin left untranslated
- No significant mistranslations
- No loss of historical meaning
- No garbled proper names

---

## Final Grade: B+

**Justification:**
- Latin phrases: Excellent (A)
- Romanesco accuracy: Very Good (A-)
- Clarity/readability: Excellent (A)
- Proper names: Excellent (A)

The B+ (rather than A) reflects minor contextual interpretation issues and the challenges of mixed-language source text. The translation quality is publication-ready with minimal editing needed.
