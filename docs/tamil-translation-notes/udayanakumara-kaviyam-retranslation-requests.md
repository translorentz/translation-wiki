## CRITICAL Priority

### Ch1 v99 -- Empty translation
- **Issue:** No translation exists for this verse. The content field is an empty string.
- **Source text:** The verse between v98 (elephant bowing) and v100 (king bestowing garland) should describe a transitional action.
- **Action:** Translate from source.

### Ch6 v64 -- Meaning likely inverted
- **Issue:** "The wise good ascetics enjoyed the desired bliss" while "thinking of" union with women. This inverts the verse's meaning. The verse describes what ascetics have RENOUNCED (attachment to female beauty seen/heard/touched), NOT what they enjoy. The Tamil verb forms likely indicate completed renunciation or hypothetical scenarios that no longer apply.
- **Source (Tamil):** பொற்புடைநன் மாதரைப் புணர்ந்துமேனி தீண்டலும் / அற்புதமாய்க் காண்டலும் ஆனவின்சொற் கேட்டலும் / கற்புடைமனத்திலெண்ணிக் காணற்கரிதாகவே / விற்பனநன் மாதவர் வேண்டுசுகந் துய்த்தனர்.
- **Correct sense:** "The wise great ascetics, having considered in their pure minds that [union with, touching, seeing, and hearing the words of beautiful women] is something difficult to perceive [as real/lasting], enjoyed the desired bliss [of liberation]."
- **Action:** Retranslate with correct Jain renunciation logic -- the ascetics enjoy MOKSHA-bliss precisely BECAUSE they have seen worldly pleasures as unreal.

## HIGH Priority

### Ch6 vv.30-31 -- Jain philosophical core rendered as empty categories
- **Issue:** "The tattvas (fundamental principles) to be known are seven in order" and "The six bodies (kayas) that speak of the excellent nine padarthas" -- these verses list Jain doctrinal categories without translating their content. The reader learns there are seven tattvas but not what they ARE.
- **Source analysis:** v30 contains "தத்துவங்கள் வரிசையின் ஏழதாமே" and v31 has "சீரிய நவபதங்கள்" -- the Tamil likely names or alludes to the components.
- **Action:** Retranslate with a Jain-philosophy-aware prompt that fills in: tattvas (jiva, ajiva, asrava, bandha, samvara, nirjara, moksha), padarthas, panchasthikaya, and the other enumerated concepts.

### Ch6 v32 -- "Path of the treatise on desire" misrendered
- **Issue:** "followed the path of the treatise on desire" -- "kaathanool vazhiyai" in context likely means "the path prescribed by the treatise [on dharma]" or "the path of the scripture of love [for liberation]," not mundane desire.
- **Action:** Retranslate with attention to Jain literary context -- "kaatha" here is probably "kaathai" (story/scripture) not "kaathal" (desire).

### Ch6 vv.58-61 -- Ascetic practices as empty numerical lists
- **Issue:** "With a single beautiful mind, with two kinds of renunciation, / They transformed the three types of attachments, and the four types of inner struggles, / Subduing the incomparable five senses..." These verses enumerate Jain ascetic disciplines by number only, without content. A reader cannot understand what is being described.
- **Action:** Retranslate with Jain ascetic terminology filled in: the two renunciations (bahya/antaranga tyaga), three attachments (raga/dvesha/moha), four passions (kashaya: krodha/mana/maya/lobha), five senses, etc.

### Ch5 v38 -- Entirely incoherent
- **Issue:** "the desired lion-fish, a powerful curse, spread from the earth and rose up beautifully" -- this makes no sense in context (describing a maiden's dream).
- **Source analysis:** The verse describes a dream. "lion-fish" may be a misreading of a compound word. "Powerful curse" seems unrelated.
- **Action:** Retranslate with attention to dream-symbolism conventions in Tamil kaviyam.

### Ch5 v50 -- Incomprehensible
- **Issue:** "by fault, two became one thousand" -- completely opaque.
- **Source analysis:** This is in the Vidyadhara conquest sequence. May refer to a magical multiplication of armies or a cosmological event.
- **Action:** Retranslate with full sentence context from surrounding verses.

### Ch1 v33 -- Tribute-refusal episode unclear
- **Issue:** "he did not know that one son had merely put a dot" -- who is "one son"? What does "putting a dot" on a tribute scroll signify? Is this a mark of refusal? Defiance?
- **Action:** Retranslate with clarification of who the agent is (Udayanan? One of Prachodanan's sons?) and what the dot signifies in the narrative (a dismissive mark indicating refusal to pay tribute).

### Ch1 v14 -- Confused narrative sequence
- **Issue:** "Her father, too, became a great sage. He went to that forest..." -- the subject referents are tangled. Whose father? The bird flew away but what happened to the woman?
- **Action:** Retranslate with explicit subjects: [The sage] went to the forest, [the great bird] placed [the pregnant queen] near [the hermit], she awoke, and the bird departed.

### Ch1 v87 -- Embedded prose header
- **Issue:** "87. Prachchothanan witnesses the elephant's frenzy. As the elephant ran in musth..." -- the verse number and a descriptive header are embedded in the translation text.
- **Action:** Strip header and retranslate as pure verse.

### Ch6 v47 -- Contradictory header + content
- **Issue:** "350. Udayanan's action: Deceitfully, having tied it with ropes, and having fiercely pierced it with sharp red thorns, he excessively imprisoned it with leg-fetters" -- this appears to describe past cruelty to the elephant, not Udayanan's current action. The header says "Udayanan's action" but the context is his compassionate approach.
- **Source analysis:** The verse likely recounts what OTHERS did to the elephant previously, which Udayanan now addresses with compassion.
- **Action:** Retranslate with correct attribution -- separate past abuse of elephant (by mahouts) from Udayanan's present compassionate address.

### Ch6 v14 -- Duplicate of v11
- **Issue:** Verses 11 and 14 are identical text ("As the armed men moved with an 'adi-adi' sound..."). Check source text to determine if this is a genuine refrain or a processing error.
- **Action:** If source text differs between vv.11 and 14, retranslate v14 from its actual source. If identical in source (refrain), leave as-is but add a note.

### Ch2 v14 -- Marriage to Virisikai without context
- **Issue:** "the noble one garlanded Virisikai, whose waist was like a thudi drum" -- this third marriage appears abruptly with no narrative setup explaining who Virisikai is or how the marriage came about.
- **Source analysis:** The Tamil may contain more contextual detail about the ascetic's daughter (the sage's daughter encountered on the mountain slope).
- **Action:** Retranslate with attention to narrative connectives -- who is "the daughter of the great ascetic"? How does the marriage occur?

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### Ch1 v4 -- Jain nirjara concept vague
- **Issue:** "the nature of such glorious shedding" -- nirjara (shedding of karma through austerity) is a key Jain concept that deserves precise rendering.
- **Action:** Retranslate with "nirjara" transliterated and glossed.

### Ch1 v20 -- Elephant's speech unmarked as supernatural
- **Issue:** The elephant speaking in human language should be flagged as remarkable in the narrative, but the transition is matter-of-fact.
- **Action:** Minor revision to signal the magical quality of this moment.

### Ch1 vv.109-114 -- Escape sequence confused
- **Issue:** The Kurathi disguise, the fire, the she-elephant escape, and the landing in the forest are narratively muddled. Who is doing what?
- **Action:** Retranslate with explicit subject identification throughout.

### Ch2 v5 -- "Yauki" without identification
- **Issue:** A new name variant appears without connection to previously established characters.
- **Action:** Standardize to "Yugi" or add "[Yugi]" in brackets.

### Ch2 vv.10-11 -- Painting scheme unclear
- **Issue:** The one-eyed painting and its role as a signal is incomprehensible.
- **Action:** Retranslate with attention to the narrative device (the painting is a recognition signal showing the ministers' loyalty).

### Ch2 vv.16-17 -- Underground tunnel scheme compressed
- **Issue:** The underground tunnel, the fire, and the queen's transfer are all crammed into two verses with insufficient clarity.
- **Action:** Retranslate with explicit cause-and-effect connectives.

### Ch2 v27 -- Meter label in text
- **Issue:** "[Kaliviruttam]" embedded in translation.
- **Action:** Strip label, retranslate clean.

### Ch2 v28 -- Section label in text
- **Issue:** "[Speaking to Udayanan]" embedded in translation.
- **Action:** Strip label, retranslate clean.

### Ch2 v30 -- Meter label in text
- **Issue:** "[Arusir Kazhinediladi Aasiriya Viruttam]" embedded.
- **Action:** Strip label, retranslate clean.

### Ch3 v5 -- Deception unclear
- **Issue:** "spoke deceitfully" to "the great Brahmin" -- who is deceiving whom and why?
- **Action:** Retranslate with clearer role identification.

### Ch3 v12 -- Treasure subplot abrupt
- **Issue:** "The king's father had kept a great treasure" appears from nowhere.
- **Action:** Retranslate with better narrative integration.

### Ch3 v23 -- Header in verse text
- **Issue:** "Darsaka gives Padmavati in marriage to Udayanan" is a header, not verse content.
- **Action:** Strip header, retranslate clean.

### Ch3 v34 -- Meter label in text
- **Issue:** "[Change of Meter]" embedded.
- **Action:** Strip, retranslate.

### Ch4 v3 -- Non sequitur
- **Issue:** "when the forest where the trunked elephant had fallen appeared, he built a mansion" -- what does this mean?
- **Action:** Retranslate with attention to the Tamil compound describing WHY a mansion was built (possibly a memorial).

### Ch4 v6 -- Label in text
- **Issue:** "[Upon seeing a dream]" embedded.
- **Action:** Strip, retranslate.

### Ch4 v43 -- Unclear subject
- **Issue:** "The lady with the beautiful forehead, distressed and without honor" -- identity and situation unclear.
- **Action:** Retranslate with identification (likely Thatthai after losing the ball competition).

### Ch4 v52 -- Meter label in text
- **Issue:** "[Arusir Kazhinediladi Aasiriya Viruttam]" embedded.
- **Action:** Strip, retranslate.

### Ch5 v12 -- Garbled names
- **Issue:** Companion-prince names partially garbled.
- **Action:** Verify Tamil names and render consistently.

### Ch5 v21 -- Meter label in text
- **Issue:** "[Kaliviruttam]" embedded.
- **Action:** Strip, retranslate.

### Ch6 v65 -- Colophon as verse
- **Issue:** The verse-count colophon is rendered as if it were a verse. This is paratext.
- **Action:** Separate as a translator's note or appendix, not part of the poem proper.

## Stage 3 Prompt Supplement (Draft)

For the retranslation of flagged verses, append this to the base Tamil translation prompt:

```
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR UDAYANAKUMARA KAVIYAM:

This is a Jain Tamil narrative poem (kaviyam) in the Perunkathai tradition, telling the story of Prince Udayanan of the Vatsa kingdom. It is NOT Sangam poetry -- ignore tinai/akam/puram conventions.

CHARACTER NAME STANDARDIZATION:
- Protagonist: Udayanan (also called Vatsavan = "lord of Vatsa")
- Chief minister: Yugi
- Companion: Vasantaka
- Minister 1: Urumannuva
- Minister 2: Idapakan
- Minister 3: Vidapaka
- Ujjain king: Prachodanan
- Queen 1: Vasavadatta (daughter of Prachodanan)
- Queen 2: Padmavati (sister of Darshaka, king of Magadha)
- Queen 3: Virisikai
- Queen 4: Maanikai (daughter of Kosala king)
- Son: Naravahana

JAIN PHILOSOPHICAL TERMS (translate precisely):
- Seven tattvas: jiva (soul), ajiva (non-soul), asrava (influx of karma), bandha (bondage of karma), samvara (stoppage of karma), nirjara (shedding of karma), moksha (liberation)
- Panchasthikaya: five extended substances (jiva, pudgala/matter, dharma/motion, adharma/rest, akasha/space)
- Navapadaartha: nine categories of reality
- Sallekhana: ritual fasting unto death (a revered Jain practice, NOT suicide)
- Samadhi-marana: death in meditative equanimity
- Samyak-darshana: right faith/perception (first of the ratna-traya)
- Siddhi: final liberation, omniscience
- Diksha: monastic initiation

METER LABELS: If the source text contains meter-change annotations (e.g., "கலிவிருத்தம்", "ஆசிரியவிருத்தம்"), do NOT include them in the translation. Omit them silently.

NARRATIVE CLARITY: When Tamil drops the subject, insert the character's name in [brackets] to maintain referential clarity. This is a connected story -- each verse must be coherent with its neighbors.
