## HIGH-Priority Systemic Issues (Prompt Improvements Needed)

### H1. Create Nandikkalambakam-Specific Prompt Supplement

**Problem:** The current `ta` prompt is entirely Sangam-focused. The Nandikkalambakam is medieval (c. 850 CE).

**Suggested prompt addition:**
```
This is a medieval Tamil kalambakam (c. 850 CE), NOT Sangam literature.
- Genre: Kalambakam (multi-verse-form praise poetry combining taravu, taazhisai, aragam, ambotharangam, thanicchol, suritagam)
- Subject: King Nandivarman III Pallava
- Key battles: Vellaaru (standardize this spelling), Kurukkottai, Veriyalur, Kadambur, Pazhaiyaaru
- Royal epithets: Avani Narayanan (= Vishnu on Earth), Kadava/Kadavar (= Pallava dynasty name), Chandira Kula Prakasan (= Light of the Lunar Dynasty)
- Geography: Kanchi/Kanchipuram (capital), Mallai/Mamallapuram (port), Mayilai/Mylapore (port), Thondai Naadu (Pallava heartland), Kaveri lands (claimed Chola territory)
- Religion: Shaiva devotional elements (Shiva as patron deity of Pallavas)
- When verse-form labels appear in parentheses (taravu, taazhisai, etc.), preserve them as [Taravu], [Taazhisai] etc. in the translation
- "Thondai" has three meanings: (1) Thondai Naadu (the region), (2) thondai fruit/creeper (Coccinia grandis, used for beauty simile), (3) thondai garland. Distinguish by context.
- "Ascending to heaven" / "ruling heaven" when applied to enemies = a death euphemism (they were killed in battle)
- The Pallava bull (vidai) emblem and single umbrella (thani kudai) are sovereignty symbols
```

### H2. Standardize Battle/Place Names

**Problem:** The same places are spelled differently across poems.

**Standardizations needed (apply to ALL 64 poems):**

| Current variations | Standard form | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Thellaaru, Vellatru, Thellatru, Thellaru, Vellaaru | Vellaaru | The battle site (c. 846 CE) |
| Kanchi, Kachi, Kanchipuram | Kanchi | The Pallava capital |
| Mallai, Nandi Mallai | Mallai | Mamallapuram |
| Thondai, Tondai, Thonthai | Thondai | (as region) |
| Avani Narayanan, AvaninaaraNan, Narayana | Avani Narayanan | Royal epithet |
| Nandi, Nanthi | Nandi | The king's name |

**Poems affected:** 2, 5, 10, 12, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 30, 33, 39, 45, 50, 51, 53, 54, 57, 62

### H3. Preserve Kalambakam Structural Labels (Poem 1 / Chapter 2)

**Problem:** The source text contains explicit verse-form labels: (taravu), (taazhisai), (aragam), (ambotharangam), (thanicchol), (suritagam). These are stripped from the translation.

**Tamil source excerpt (from chapter 2):**
```
மண்டலமாய்... சிவனே நின் திருமேனி.(தரவு)
...செம்பாகந் திறம்பிற்றே
...உள்ளமுமே யுவந்தனையே.
...செழுமலர்சே வடிதொழவே.(தாழிசை)
செழுமலர்... நிறுவினை.(அராகம்)
...அசைத்தனையே
...ஏகாச மிட்டனையே. (தாழிசை)
...வெங்கூற்றம்.(அம்போதரங்கம்)
...இறைவனுநீ.(அம்போதரங்கம்)
எனவாங்கு,(தனிச்சொல்)
ஒருபெருங் கடவுணிற்...(சுரிதகம்)
```

**Current English:** No structural labels at all.

**Suggested correction:** Insert labels as section headers:
```
[Taravu]
As the earth, as the sky...

[Taazhisai]
O mountain-chested one...

[Aragam]
Your forehead, emitting fire...

[Taazhisai]
Through your matted locks...

[Ambotharangam]
The powerful poison you consumed...
You are birth in all worlds...

[Thanicchol]
Thus,

[Suritagam]
We praise you, the one great God...
```

### H4. Resolve Thondai Polysemy Consistently

**Problem:** "Thondai" means three different things and the translation confuses them.

**Specific fixes needed:**

| Poem | Tamil | Current English | Correct English |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 10 (ch 11) | தொண்டை நந்தி தோள் | "Nandi... shoulders" | "Nandi, lord of Thondai [region]... [his] shoulders" |
| 31 (ch 32) | தொண்டைக் கொடி | "anthondai creeper" | "thondai creeper (Coccinia grandis)" |
| 40 (ch 41) | தொண்டை | "his... Thondai" | "his thondai [garland/realm]" -- ambiguous in source |
| 41 (ch 42) | மென் றொண்டை | "tender ThoNDai" | "the tender thondai [fruit/garland]" -- likely the thondai fruit (red lips) |
| 42 (ch 43) | not explicit | "greatness of mighty Nandi" | Context suggests Thondai Naadu (the region) |

### H5. Fix Ironic "Heaven" Euphemism (Poems 18, 19, 20)

**Problem:** "Foolish kings... will rule the heavens" must clearly convey that this means they will be KILLED.

**Poem 18 (ch 19):**
- Tamil: "மதியிலி யரசர்நின் மலரடி பணிகிலர் வானக மாள் வாரே"
- Current: "The foolish kings who do not bow at your lotus feet, they will rule the heavens."
- Problem: Reads as if "ruling heaven" is a reward.
- Fix: "The foolish kings who refuse to bow at your lotus feet -- they shall rule only the heavens [i.e., they shall perish]."

**Poem 20 (ch 21) already handles this well:** "All kings who did not join him ascended to heaven" -- the context makes the death-meaning clear. No fix needed.

---

## MEDIUM-Priority Individual Poem Fixes

### M1. Poem 8 (Chapter 9) — Misidentification of Subject

**Tamil:** புயங்களிற் பூவைமார் பொங்கு கொங்கையின் / நயங்கொளத் தகுபுகழ் நந்தி கச்சிசூழ் / கயங்களிற் கடிமலர் துழாவிக் காமுகர் / பயங்கொளப் புகுந்தது பருவ வாடையே

**Current:** "To women, with swelling breasts on their shoulders, / In the region surrounding Kanchi, of Nandi whose fame is worthy of admiration, / The seasonal vaadai entered, causing distress, / Stirring fragrant flowers in the ponds, like lovers."

**Problem:** The poem's subject is the seasonal north wind (vaadai) entering the ponds around Kanchi and disturbing lovers -- a standard love-poem scenario. The translation is mostly correct but "on their shoulders" for "puyankaL" is wrong. "puyankaL" = arms/shoulders of the WOMEN (i.e., women whose breasts swell against their arms). Minor syntactic fix needed.

**Suggested:** "The seasonal north wind entered the region of Kanchi -- the land of Nandi whose fame commands admiration -- stirring fragrant flowers in the ponds, and causing distress to lovers, while women's swelling breasts (pressed against their arms) were stirred by desire."

### M2. Poem 7 (Chapter 8) — Subject Completely Garbled

**Tamil:** The poem describes the king's magnificent shoulders being compared to various things (elephants, flowers, women's delight, etc.)

**Current:** "Cupid's elephant, which establishes its direction... O excellent one, these are your glorious shoulders."

**Problem:** The translation is nearly incoherent. The Tamil is a taazhisai (linked verse) praising the king's shoulders through cascading similes. The referent keeps shifting because the translation loses track of the Tamil's syntactic subordination.

**Suggested approach:** Restructure as: "O excellent one! Your glorious shoulders -- they are [like] Cupid's elephant that conquers all directions; they delight women with jewel-like smiles; they soften the hearts of victorious kings; they contend with fragrant flowers; they are praised by garlands of the mighty..."

### M3. Poem 14 (Chapter 15) — "Tiger Emblem King"

**Tamil:** வடுபுலிக்கோன் = "vaṭu-puli-kōn" = "the king of the scarred/marked tiger [emblem]"

**Current:** "the king with the tiger emblem"

**Problem:** This is the Chola king (whose emblem is a tiger). The translation should identify this: "the Chola king of the tiger emblem" -- clarifying that this is an ENEMY city being contrasted with Nandi's.

### M4. Poem 28 (Chapter 29) — "Husband of Ganga" Error

**Tamil:** கங்கை மணாளன் = "kankai maNaaLan" = husband of Ganga -- likely refers to Shiva (who received the Ganga river in his matted locks) but here applied as an epithet of Nandi.

**Current:** "husband of Ganga, valorous Nandi"

**Problem:** This is not a geographical reference to the Ganges river but a RELIGIOUS epithet. Nandi is being compared to Shiva (who "married" the Ganga). Should be rendered as: "he who is [like Shiva,] husband of the Ganga."

### M5. Poem 32 (Chapter 33) — Kadaiyaaru Identification

**Tamil:** கடையாறு போந்தார் கலந்து = "kaTaiyaaRu poonthaar kalanthu"

**Current:** "Kadaiyaaru came, joining him."

**Problem:** "Kadaiyaaru" is likely a place name (a river/location). "poonthaar kalanthu" = "came having joined/mingled." The sense is: "[the victors] came, having mingled [in victory] at Kadaiyaaru." But the current translation makes "Kadaiyaaru" sound like a person who came.

**Suggested:** "Those from Kadaiyaaru came, having joined [the victorious host]."

### M6. Poem 38 (Chapter 39) — Churning Mythology Identification

**Tamil:** The poem compares Nandi to Vishnu churning the ocean (the Samudra Manthana myth).

**Current:** "They say it was Vishnu who, in the ancient ocean teeming with makaras, churned the great mountain..."

**Problem:** The "makara" (mythical sea creature) reference is correct, but "churned the great mountain on the shore" is wrong. The mountain (Mandara/Meru) was used AS the churning rod IN the ocean, not "on the shore."

**Suggested:** "They say it was Vishnu who, in the ancient ocean teeming with makaras, churned [the ocean] using the great mountain [as churning rod], while its vast sprays, carrying fish, tore upward to the cold sky."

### M7. Poem 46 (Chapter 47) — Garbled Simile

**Tamil:** The speaker complains about being abandoned, comparing their withered dignity to something related to the King of Mallai's elephants.

**Current:** "you have allowed my dignified, sky-like, mountain-like shoulders to wither, like the large elephant tracks of the King of Mallai"

**Problem:** The simile direction is confused. The Tamil likely says: "my shoulders, [once] like the sky, like mountains, [now] wither -- you have done this [just as] the King of Mallai's elephant [leaves deep tracks]." The elephant tracks are not the comparand for the withered shoulders; they represent the DEPTH of injury caused.

### M8. Poem 47 (Chapter 48) — Incoherent Conclusion

**Tamil:** நைய நாமிவ னகரிகை தொழிதிலம் / நம்முயி ரளவன்றே

**Current:** "we did not conquer his domain, to our defeat; our lives are not enough."

**Problem:** "naiya" = "to be destroyed/to wither"; "naam ivan nakarikkai tozhitilam" = "we did not bow/worship/work for this woman's [love]"; "nam uyir aLavu anRE" = "it is beyond the measure of our lives." The correct sense is: "If we [go to] that woman and fail to win her, we are destroyed; our lives would not suffice [for such an endeavor]."

### M9. Poem 50 (Chapter 51) — Wordplay Lost

**Tamil:** The poem is built on the repeated word "kOvE" and "maalai" with shifting meanings:
- kOvE = "O king!" (vocative) / "lord" / "bull"
- maalai = garland / evening / Vishnu (Maal) / delusion

**Current:** "O Lord, a garland, as a garland, O Lord, the bee, [and] blue, boon-bestowing eyes..."

**Problem:** The translation is nearly unintelligible. The Tamil is a virtuoso display of sandalippu (punning/word-splitting), a characteristic kalambakam technique. Each line uses "kOvE maalai" with different word-boundaries and meanings.

**Suggested approach:** This poem may be untranslatable in the usual sense. Suggest rendering each line with the PRIMARY meaning, then adding a note explaining the wordplay:
- Line 1: "O King, [you are] a garland! If [one takes] this garland as [merely] a garland..."
- Line 2: "O King, [you who wear] garlands, if one accepts [your] garland, I know not how to speak [its praise]."
- Line 3: "O King, [you are] the garlanded one! The victorious Nandi of Kanchi with the tall crown."
- Line 4: "O King, among garlands, our Lord became the bull-bannered one."

Add note: "[This poem employs sandalippu, a Tamil rhetorical device where identical syllable sequences yield different meanings through re-parsing.]"

### M10. Poem 60 (Chapter 61) — Syntactic Mess

**Tamil:** A head-to-toe beauty description (nakh-shikh) of a woman.

**Current:** Contains bizarre line-break artifacts: "her lips are like Mayan's thondai fruit,\n\nred like that beautiful fruit, blooming on her sacred face." -- the double line breaks within a single sentence suggest a batching/formatting error.

**Problem:** The translation has random paragraph breaks within what should be a flowing beauty description. The content is approximately correct but the formatting destroys readability.

**Suggested:** Remove all internal paragraph breaks. Render as a single flowing passage.

### M11. Poem 27 (Chapter 28) — "Kanchukan" Misidentification

**Tamil:** வீர தீரநல் விறலவிர்கஞ்சுகன் = "veera theera nal viRal avir kanchukan"

**Current:** "Kanchukan, whose heroic valor shines, who won the battle at Veriyalur."

**Problem:** "Kanchukan" is NOT a separate person's name. It likely means "the one who shines in Kanchi" (kanchi + ukan) or is an epithet of Nandi himself. The translation treats it as a proper name of a different warrior.

**Suggested:** "The heroic, valorous one who shines [in Kanchi], who won the battle at Veriyalur..." (referring to Nandi himself).

### M12. Poem 12 (Chapter 13) — "Kali" Misidentification

**Tamil:** சினக்கலியின் வெஞ்சாயன் மறைத்த தனிக்குடையான்

**Current:** "who concealed the fierce shadow of wrathful Kali"

**Problem:** "kali" here is NOT the goddess Kali. In medieval Tamil, "kali" = the Kali age (Kali Yuga), turbulence, or battle-fury. "sinakk kaliyin venchaayal maRaitta" = "who concealed/overcame the fierce shade/influence of the wrathful Kali [age/turbulence]."

**Suggested:** "who hid the fierce shadow of this turbulent age beneath his sole umbrella"

## LOW-Priority Stylistic Fixes

### L1. Standardize "scepter" spelling and phrasing
- Use "righteous scepter" consistently (not "just scepter" or "one scepter")
- Affected poems: 5, 12, 20, 36, 42, 54, 58

### L2. Standardize "elephant" terminology
- kaLiRu = "bull elephant" (not just "elephant")
- yaanai = "elephant" (generic)
- matha yaanai = "musth elephant" (in rutting state)
- Affected: throughout

### L3. Clarify "warrior anklets" vs decorative anklets
- veera kazhal = warrior anklets (military insignia)
- silambu = women's anklets (decorative/musical)
- These are culturally distinct objects and should not both be "anklets"

### L4. Standardize moon/umbrella sovereignty formula
- "single umbrella" or "sole umbrella" (not "one umbrella" or "white umbrella")
- The umbrella is a sovereignty symbol; "white" is sometimes added but the KEY word is "single/sole" (thani/oru)

### L5. Render "Kaveri" consistently
- Sometimes "Kaveri," sometimes "Ponni" (= golden, an epithet of the Kaveri)
- When the Tamil says "Ponni," render as "the Ponni (Kaveri)" on first occurrence, then just "Ponni" thereafter

### L6. Poem 37 (Chapter 38) — "golden bard"
- "pon vaLar paaNan" more likely = "the bard who seeks gold/wealth" or "the bard who makes gold grow [through his praise]" rather than "our golden bard"

### L7. Poem 34 (Chapter 35) — "Nandi Mallai" ambiguity
- "Nandi Mallai" can mean: (a) Nandi's Mallai (= the king's port city), (b) the bull mountain, or (c) a compound place name. The translation should be consistent.

### L8. Poem 30 (Chapter 31) — "anthoNTai"
- "anthondai" should be glossed as "thondai creeper" (Coccinia grandis) -- it's a specific plant whose red berries are compared to women's lips in Tamil poetry.

## Summary of Retranslation Priorities

### For the Master Retranslator (Stage 4):

**Before retranslating:**
1. Create the Nandikkalambakam-specific prompt supplement (H1)
2. Build a standardization table for proper names (H2)
3. Decide on a consistent approach to thondai polysemy (H4)

**Poems requiring full retranslation (PROBLEMATIC rating):**
- Poem 7 (ch 8) — subject garbled
- Poem 14 (ch 15) — incoherent (but note: this poem may be genuinely corrupt in the source)
- Poem 18 (ch 19) — ironic meaning lost
- Poem 28 (ch 29) — "husband of Ganga" and geography confused
- Poem 32 (ch 33) — kurinji-tinai allusion lost + speaker confusion
- Poem 38 (ch 39) — confused simile relationships
- Poem 44 (ch 45) — geography soup
- Poem 46 (ch 47) — simile direction wrong
- Poem 47 (ch 48) — conclusion incoherent
- Poem 50 (ch 51) — wordplay-poem needs special treatment
- Poem 60 (ch 61) — formatting artifacts

**Poems requiring targeted fixes (ADEQUATE with specific errors):**
- All poems with battle-name inconsistencies (H2 list)
- All poems with thondai confusion (H4 list)
- Poem 12 (ch 13) — "Kali" = Kali age, not goddess
- Poem 27 (ch 28) — "Kanchukan" is not a person
- Poem 39 (ch 40) — ocean-churning myth details
- Poem 42 (ch 43) — "ThoNDai" sense unclear

**For remaining 50 poems (chapters 65-114):**
- Apply the improved prompt (H1) from the start
- Use the standardization table (H2) to ensure consistency
- These should be higher quality than the first 64 if the prompt is fixed

---

## Metrics for Success (Stage 4 Verification)

After retranslation, the following should be true:
1. All references to the Vellaaru battle use the same spelling
2. All references to Kanchi use the same spelling
3. Thondai-as-region, thondai-as-fruit, thondai-as-garland are distinguishable
4. Poem 1 (chapter 2) contains verse-form labels
5. The "heaven = death" euphemism is unambiguous in all occurrences
6. PROBLEMATIC-rated poems achieve at least ADEQUATE on re-review
7. No new errors introduced by the prompt changes
