## PREREQUISITE: Source Text Reprocessing

Before any retranslation can proceed, the following must be fixed:

### P1. Strip Commentary from Chapters 3-5 (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The source text for chapters 3-5 (from `data/raw/yashodhara-kaviyam/yashodhara-kaviyam-carukkam-3-5.txt`) was not properly stripped of medieval Tamil commentary (urai). The commentary is being translated alongside the verse text.

**Action required:**
1. Update `scripts/process-yashodhara-kaviyam.ts` to identify and strip commentary sections
2. Commentary markers to detect:
   - Prose paragraphs between verses (Tamil commentary is prose, verses are in metre)
   - Citation markers like "என்றது" (this means), "என்பது" (this is), "என்றார்" (they said -- when introducing explanation)
   - Cross-references to other texts (e.g., "Tolkappiyam Porulathikaram 557", "Civaka. 1315", "Mani. 22:138")
   - Explanatory phrases that unpack individual words of the verse
3. Re-process chapters 3-5 with commentary stripped
4. Re-seed the database with clean chapter JSON files
5. Retranslate chapters 3-5 with clean source text

**Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks all chapter 3-5 work)
**Affected paragraphs:** ~30-46% of chapters 3, 4, 5

## Structural Retranslation Requests

### S1. Chapter 1, Verses 57-73 (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Verses 57-66 are truncated to single-sentence summaries; verses 68-72 are completely empty. Verse 67 appears to contain a merged translation of multiple verses.

**Current state:**
- idx 57: `"[57] [58] Maaridattan orders them to be placed on the royal throne.\n"`
- idx 58: `"[58] [59] Those nearby said, "`
- idx 59: `"[59] [60] Both of them praised the King.\n"`
- idx 60-66: Similar fragments
- idx 68-72: Empty strings

**Action:** Retranslate all 17 verses (57-73) as a complete batch with sufficient output token allocation. These verses contain:
- Maridattan's recognition of the ascetics' nobility (57-58)
- The crowd's reaction (59)
- Maridattan's wonder at their serenity (60-61)
- Abhayaruchi's explanation of why they laughed at death (62-63)
- The king's request for their past-life story (64-65)
- The transition into Abhayaruchi's narration (66-73)

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Verse range:** 57-73 (17 verses, chapter 1)

---

### S2. Chapter 2, Verses 80-82 (HIGH)

**Problem:** Ashoka's philosophical reflections on aging and impermanence (verses 80-82) are empty or truncated. These motivate his renunciation in verse 83.

**Current state:**
- idx 6 (v.80): `"[80] Ashoka Ponders Many Things in His Mind\n"`
- idx 7 (v.81): `"[81] Ashoka Reflects on the Impermanence of Youth's Prosperity Within Himself\n"`
- idx 8 (v.82): `"[82] 1,2 Natrinai 126. Ashoka Realizes that Only Virtuous Deeds Should Be Done, and Becomes Clear\n"`

**Action:** Retranslate verses 80-82 with their full Tamil source text. Also fix verse 76 (idx 2) which cuts off mid-sentence.

**Priority:** HIGH
**Verse range:** 76, 80-82 (4 verses, chapter 2)

---

### S3. Chapters 3-5 Full Retranslation (CRITICAL -- after P1)

**Problem:** After commentary stripping (P1), chapters 3-5 will need complete retranslation from clean source text.

**Action:** After P1 is complete, retranslate all of:
- Chapter 3: 65 verses (161-225)
- Chapter 4: 36 verses (226-261)
- Chapter 5: 69 verses (262-330)

**Priority:** CRITICAL (but dependent on P1)
**Verse range:** 161-330 (170 verses total)

---

### S4. Character Name Standardization (HIGH -- apply to all retranslation)

**Problem:** Same characters spelled differently across and within chapters.

**Action:** Include this character name list in the retranslation prompt:

```
MANDATORY CHARACTER NAMES (use exactly these spellings):
- Yashodhara (the king of Ujjayini, main protagonist)
- Chandramati (his mother, Queen of Ashoka)
- Amritamati (his wife, the antagonist queen)
- Ashoka (his father, King of Ujjayini)
- Yasomati (Yashodhara's son, later king)
- Abhayaruchi (the prince-ascetic narrator; also Abhayakumara)
- Abhayamati (his sister, the princess-ascetic)
- Maridattan (King of Rajapura, the listener/frame-story king)
- Attapangan (the charioteer-musician, Amritamati's lover)
- Gunavati (Amritamati's companion/handmaid)
- Pushpavali (Yasomati's queen)
- Chandakaruman (Yasomati's executioner, later Jain convert)
- Agampana (the sage who teaches Chandakaruman)
- Sudatta Muni (the sage who teaches Yasomati)
- Kalyanamitra (Yasomati's merchant-friend)
```

**Priority:** HIGH
**Scope:** All chapters

## Verse-Level Retranslation Requests

### V1. Chapter 1, Verse 1 (Invocation) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** "kevalam" rendered as "pure knowledge" -- should be "omniscience" (Jain-specific term for perfect knowledge attained by Tirthankaras and Siddhas).

**Current:** "We praise the glorious lotus feet, Of the boundless ocean of infinite virtues, Who possesses the world's order and pure, unblemished knowledge."

**Fix:** Replace "pure, unblemished knowledge" with "omniscience (kevala-jnana)"

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V2. Chapter 1, Verse 23 -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** "Anasana penance" is opaque. The practice of sallekhana (ritual fasting) is a distinctive Jain concept that needs brief explanation.

**Current:** "The noble one, along with the relatives he had spoken of earlier, Undertook the Anasana penance, having taken the Antilaasana vow."

**Fix:** Render as "undertook the sallekhana [ritual fast]" or "undertook the anasana [fasting] vow"

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V3. Chapter 1, Verse 28 -- HIGH

**Problem:** The verse describing Chandakaruman seizing the two ascetics is garbled and incoherent.

**Current:** "If they are not to be approached, yet if seen, they are like those who, having kept a cow, fear it. I have seen them, I have seen them!"

**Action:** Retranslate with awareness that this verse describes Chandakaruman (the king's man) seeing the ascetic twins and recognizing them as suitable for the human sacrifice the king demanded.

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### V4. Chapter 2, Verse 145 (flour rooster miracle) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** The theological significance of the flour rooster coming alive and crowing when Yashodhara cuts it is unclear. This is the karmic turning point -- even a symbolic sacrifice produces real karmic consequences.

**Current:** "did the rooster, which was a mere image, have its head cut off? Before the righteous king, it crowed and trembled and fell."

**Fix:** Clarify that the inanimate flour-form came alive through the power of the king's murderous intention, demonstrating that even intention to kill generates karma.

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V5. Chapter 4, Verse 237 (conch analogy) -- HIGH

**Problem:** The sage's analogy about air and sound is incomprehensible in English.

**Current:** "When air is quickly drawn in, and the mouth is tightly closed and lifted, even after that air has entered and departed, and it is weighed, it is similar to a person [blowing] a conch. From where did the 'thik' sound come for a single-storied mansion?"

**Action:** This verse is the sage's response to Chandakaruman's materialist argument ("I cut people open and never found a soul"). The analogy is: just as you cannot weigh the air that produces a conch's sound, yet the sound exists, so too the soul exists without being materially detectable. Retranslate with this logic made clear.

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### V6. Chapter 5, Verse 295 (hell levels) -- HIGH

**Problem:** Numerics garbled -- the verse likely refers to specific Jain hell levels or time periods.

**Current:** "Above ten and fifteen, pushed beyond, Rising smoke, which is beyond twenty-five, Unparalleled sorrows surge and fall with it, O giver of light, equal to ten and seven seas!"

**Action:** Research the Jain cosmological numbering system for hell levels (there are 7 hells in Jain cosmology: Ratnaprabhā through Mahātamaḥprabhā). The numbers 10, 15, 25, 17 likely refer to specific time durations (sāgaropama units) or suffering intensities. Retranslate with correct interpretation.

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### V7. Chapter 1, Verse 2 (Prologue) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** "Suvrata" is rendered as "Suvradan" -- this is likely a reference to a Tirthankara (possibly the 20th Tirthankara, Munisuvrata). The verse establishes the religious authority for the story.

**Current:** "On the day our Lord, the sage Suvradan, bestowed The glorious holy place that removes evil"

**Fix:** Clarify that "Suvrata" is a Tirthankara name and "tirtha" means "ford" (to liberation), not "holy place."

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V8. Chapter 2, Verse 86 (Yashodhara abandoning dharma) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** The Kambar Ramayanam reference in the verse header is a commentary cross-reference that should not be in the translation.

**Current:** "[86] 1. Kambar Ramayanam, Bala Kandam. Yashodhara, Due to the Arrogance of Wealth, Loosens His Grip on Dharma"

**Fix:** Remove the cross-reference. The header should just be "Yashodhara Abandons Dharma Due to the Arrogance of Wealth"

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V9. Chapter 3, Verse 185-186 (Shraddha ceremony) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** The connection between eating the Lohita fish as an ancestral offering and the karmic consequences is unclear. The fish IS Yashodhara reborn -- eating it in a Shraddha ceremony dedicated to Yashodhara is darkly ironic.

**Current:** "Yasomathi bit into a piece of the cut fish. The evil-doers said, 'May Yasodharan prosper in heaven...'"

**Fix:** Make the dramatic irony explicit: Yasomati is unknowingly eating his own father's reborn form while performing a ceremony for his father's spiritual benefit.

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V10. Chapter 5, Verse 317 (karma types) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** The eight karma types are transliterated but not translated or explained.

**Current:** "gnanaavaraneeyam (knowledge-obscuring), darisanaavaraneeyam (perception-obscuring), moganeeyam (deluding), and antharaayam (obstructing), along with vedaneeyam (feeling-producing), naamigam (body-making), goththirigam (status-determining), and aayutkam (life-span determining)"

**Fix:** This is actually acceptable as-is with the glosses in parentheses. However, note that this paragraph is COMMENTARY, not verse text, and should be removed in the P1 fix. If retained as a footnote/gloss, it is useful.

**Priority:** LOW (will be removed by P1 fix)

---

### V11. Chapter 2, Verse 160 (chapter conclusion) -- MEDIUM

**Problem:** The transition from Abhayaruchi's narration back to the frame story is unclear. The verse addresses Maridattan directly but the shift in speaker is not signaled.

**Current:** "If you understand the nature of such deeds, then such companions will be formed... O Maridatta, crowned with a garland of crafted flowers, is foolish, he said."

**Fix:** Clarify that Abhayaruchi is addressing Maridattan (the frame-story listener) and drawing a moral lesson from Yashodhara's story.

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### V12. Chapter 1, Verse 4 (Subject Matter) -- LOW

**Problem:** The verse states the text's purpose but the translation is somewhat vague.

**Current:** "To make known how to prevent fierce karma when it arises, How unparalleled virtue brings enjoyment, And how the fruit of actions performed will be thus-- This is the purpose of this work."

**Fix:** Tighten: "To reveal how fierce karma, once arisen, may be prevented; how peerless virtue brings its reward; and how the fruit of deeds -- whether good or evil -- comes to pass: such is the subject of this work."

**Priority:** LOW

## Summary of Retranslation Priorities

| Priority | Items | Scope |
|----------|-------|-------|
| CRITICAL | P1 (strip commentary), S1 (Ch.1 v.57-73), S3 (Ch.3-5 full) | 187 verses + reprocessing |
| HIGH | S2 (Ch.2 v.76,80-82), S4 (names), V3, V5, V6 | 7 verses + prompt fix |
| MEDIUM | V1, V2, V4, V7, V8, V9, V11, V12 | 8 individual verses |
| LOW | V10 | 1 verse (may be removed by P1) |

**Total retranslation scope:** After P1 is complete, approximately 194 verses need retranslation (170 in chapters 3-5, plus 17 in chapter 1, plus 4 in chapter 2, plus individual fixes).

**Estimated effort:** This is a near-complete retranslation of the text (194 of 330 verses = 59%), driven primarily by the commentary contamination in the source processing. Chapters 1-2, once their gaps are filled, are largely serviceable.
