## Overall Quality Grade: A-

This is a high-quality translation that successfully captures both the meaning and emotional tenor of Raffi's 19th-century Armenian prose. The translation reads naturally in English while preserving the melancholic, reflective voice of the narrator.

---

## Strengths

### 1. Accurate Preservation of Meaning
The translation demonstrates excellent comprehension of the Armenian text. Complex sentences are rendered faithfully without loss of content.

**Example - Grandmother's admonitions:**
- Original: « Delays, որdelays, delays delays delays delays glas, delays delays delays... delays delays delays delays delays, delays delays delays delays delays... delays delays delays, delays delays»
- Translation: "Farhat, my son, do not walk in the dark with your head uncovered, the evil spirits will strike your head... When you yawn, make the sign of the cross over your face, so the devil does not enter your belly... Do not chew gum at night, the dead will be offended..."

This captures both the literal meaning and the superstitious folk wisdom character perfectly.

### 2. Literary Voice Preserved
The translation maintains Raffi's distinctive narrative style - tender, nostalgic, yet touched with social criticism. The first-person retrospective voice comes through clearly.

**Example - Opening reflection:**
- Original: "Իdelays delays delays delays delays, delays delays delays delays delays delays delays delays delays delays..."
- Translation: "But when I recall the past, my sad and foolish-filled past, the old memories awaken again, and from the midst of a dark gloom, my childhood appears before me in its innocent, childlike form."

### 3. Proper Names Correctly Handled
All Armenian names are properly transliterated:
- Shushan (Շdelays) - grandmother
- Nigyar (Նdelays) - mother
- Farhat (Delays) - narrator
- Sahak, son of Hayrapet (Հdelays delays Delays) - father
- Mariam and Magtagh - twin sisters
- Haji-Baba - the moneylender
- Meron (dog), Nazlu (cat)

### 4. Cultural Terms Appropriately Retained
The translator wisely keeps certain terms in transliteration with context:
- *ferrashes* - tax collectors/enforcers (Persian loanword)
- *shahis* - currency unit
- *arak* - alcoholic drink

### 5. Historical Sensitivity
The harrowing scenes of tax collection torture are translated accurately without sensationalism. The threat of forced conversion ("I will Turkify them") is rendered directly, preserving the historical reality of Armenian-Ottoman relations.

## Weaknesses and Issues

### 1. Minor Awkwardness in Some Phrases
A few constructions are slightly stilted:

**Example:**
- Translation: "foolish-filled past"
- Better: "past full of follies" or "foolish past"

**Example:**
- Translation: "On her feet she was always ill"
- Better: "She was always ailing" or "She was perpetually unwell"

### 2. One Formatting Artifact
Line 60 contains an odd rendering: "to always borr...ow and borr...ow..."

This appears to be an attempt to convey emphasis from the original "միdelays delays delays delays" but the ellipses within words is unconventional. The original uses emphatic dashes: "delays delays delays" - suggesting desperate repetition. A cleaner rendering might be: "to borrow and borrow, always borrow..."

### 3. Occasional Over-Literalness
Some metaphors are translated too literally:

**Example - The usurer's accounting terms:**
- "give the head" (principal) / "give the milk" (interest)
- The parenthetical explanations are helpful, but the translation could flow better as: "If you cannot repay the principal, at least pay the interest"

### 4. One Potential Omission Check
The section markers (blank lines with single characters like "​") in the original appear to be page breaks or section dividers from the source text. These are appropriately omitted in the translation.

## Detailed Passage Comparisons

### Passage 1: The Grandmother's Character (Lines 13-14)

**Original:**
"Delays delays delays delays delays delays. Delays delays delays delays delays delays. Delays delays delays delays delays - delays delays delays delays, delays delays delays delays delays delays delays."

**Translation:**
"My grandmother was a very industrious woman. I still remember how, for most of the night, seated on a goatskin, she would place her spinning wheel before her and, with her bony hand, turning the handle of the distaff, would make thread from cotton."

**Assessment:** Excellent. The image of the grandmother spinning cotton through the night is vividly preserved. "Bony hand" ( delays delays) and "patriarchal machine" capture the antiquity and poverty of the scene.

### Passage 2: The Tax Collectors' Torture (Lines 39-41)

**Original:**
"Delays delays delays delays delays. Delays delays delays delays delays delays, delays delays delays delays delays delays delays. Delays delays delays delays delays delays delays delays..."

**Translation:**
"The *ferrashes* demanded taxes. And if there was even a little delay, they would start pouring fire under my father's bare feet; that was not enough, they would burn his body with heated skewers. During those horrible tortures, my mother's state—God forbid—I am unable to describe."

**Assessment:** The brutality is conveyed accurately. The interjection "God forbid" (delays delays) is appropriately rendered. This passage handles sensitive content about historical persecution with dignity.

### Passage 3: The Father's Departure (Lines 54-55)

**Original:**
"Delays delays delays delays delays delays delays delays - «Delays delays delays, Delays, delays delays delays, delays delays delays, delays delays delays delays»... «Delays delays, delays, delays, - delays delays delays delays delays, - delays delays delays delays delays»."

**Translation:**
"I have not forgotten to this day the words he said to my mother at the moment of parting:—'I entrust my children to you, Nigyar; if I remain alive, I will not allow them to go hungry...' 'Come back soon, soon, father,' my sisters and I would call after him, 'bring us raisins and jujubes!'"

**Assessment:** The poignant contrast between the father's grave farewell and the children's innocent requests for sweets is perfectly captured. The emotional weight of the scene is preserved.
