I
FAMILY

I can write very little of my childhood, for it passed so quickly and so emptily that I myself do not remember much of it.

But when I recall the past, my sad and foolish-filled past, the old memories awaken again, and from the midst of a dark gloom, my childhood appears before me in its innocent, childlike form.

Here, familiar images emerge one after another—

I see the family cottage with its old walls, worn down by the ravages of time. The same leafy trees still shade it with their enormous branches, the same sparrows still sing upon the boughs; it seems to me as if I were familiar with their cunning little faces.

It seems not much time has passed, it seems as if it were only yesterday—I see my old grandmother, seated in her usual place, opposite the door of our hut. Again, the same walnut tree shelters her hoary head from the fiery rays of the summer sun. She sits, as always, silent and pensive. On her knees slumbers her intimate companion—the enormous, furry cat, probably seeing sweet dreams.

Beloved grandmother, even at this moment, in the dark-yellow wrinkles of your face, I see the same kindness as before, and now your eyes, full of pity, look upon me with ancient love. It seems to me as if I still hear your wise admonitions:—"Farhat, my son, do not walk in the dark with your head uncovered, the evil spirits will strike your head... When you yawn, make the sign of the cross over your face, so the devil does not enter your belly... Do not chew gum at night, the dead will be offended..." You gave me many such admonitions, you warned me not to enter ruins... you warned me not to pass alone near the cemetery... and not to play with a black cat...

My grandmother was called Shushan. She had inherited her mother's name. How old she was—I still do not know even now. But she had been a witness to such events over which centuries had passed. Nevertheless, she had not completely lost her vigor. You would see her, like an indefatigable machine, from morning till evening, in constant motion. Her all-seeing eyes would look upon everything and observe everything; her restless tongue would ask questions about everything and demand endless accounts and calculations. Until her death, she did not let go of the scepter of her governance—the enormous wooden ladle with which she distributed food at supper and dinner. Until her death, both the great and the small of our house submitted to her authority with all humility.

My grandmother was a very industrious woman. I still remember how, for most of the night, seated on a goatskin, she would place her spinning wheel before her and, with her bony hand, turning the handle of the distaff, would make thread from cotton. It seems to me as if the old woman's quavering melody still strikes my ears with its sad, melancholic sounds; it seems to me as if I still hear the dull creaking of her patriarchal machine.

In our village, my grandmother was considered one of the wise old women, and within her home, her wisdom reached infallibility. To tell the truth, I too, in my childhood, was amazed by her wisdom. She knew everything. She knew what significance this or that dream had. She knew what it meant when this or that part of a person's body "itched." She understood the language of the magpie and explained what good news it brought when it chattered, perched on our wall. She could not bear the ominous sound of the owl and ordered me to kill it with a stone when it sat on our wall. She knew why Solomon the Wise cursed the sparrow, or who placed that beautiful feathered comb upon the hoopoe's head.

Yes, my grandmother knew many things. She would tell me how the end of the world would come, or when the Antichrist would appear. She said that the accursed Antichrist would come, seated on a huge donkey, that his donkey's ears would be so long that the tip of one would reach the west and the other the east. She said that at that time the "Gog and Magog" would appear, that they were such tiny dwarves that my shoes could serve as dwellings for them.

But I loved my grandmother's fairy tales more.

I still remember a few fairy tales she would tell at night. Sometimes, a fairy tale she began would take a whole week to finish. Ah, how well she told them. I understood all, all of it and always listened with joy. But when she spoke of devils, demons, fiends, and hell—I would be terrified, and I was even more afraid when she spoke of the dead.

And when my grandmother died, I was not afraid of her. She was lying in the coffin in a very peaceful manner, as if asleep. Her face was still as kind as before. I thought she would go to the angels, because she never beat me. When they buried her, I cried a great deal. My mother said that one day she would rise from the grave; I was glad.

My mother was called Nigyar. Have you seen a flower that has just opened but withered in its bud?—that was my mother. Poor woman, I can never forget your ever-sad and pale face. Why could you not be happy... Why were your beautiful eyes so lifeless, from which tears were scarcely ever absent...

My mother was a tall woman, with a thin and weak build. On her feet she was always ill, but she never lay down. "Who will keep my children?"—she would answer when they told her she must rest a little, that she must recuperate her exhausted strength a little. She had no rest the whole day. She baked the bread for our house, she cooked the meals, she washed our clothes, she sewed and mended our garments. But it was not the domestic cares that wore her down—her pain was from the heart... I did not understand it then, but I understand it now...

In our village, my mother's skill in sewing and tailoring was praised, but they paid very little for her labors. She barely earned a few *shahis* a week; and we lived on them. After my grandmother's death, the entire burden of the house fell upon my mother. My sisters, Mariam and Magtagh, were still little; they hindered my mother more than they helped her.

Mariam and Magtagh were twins, so similar to each other that I often mistook one for the other. To recognize them, my mother had sewn caps of different colors—Mariam's was green, and Magtagh's was red. I still remember those innocent quarrels that arose between these two angels over their caps. The reasons were very amusing; for example, when Mariam was loved, Magtagh would snatch her cap, put it on her own head, so that she too would become Mariam and be loved as well.

I was a very restless child, but still my mother did not beat me, because I was her only son. My mother's love reached such a degree of indulgence that she often forgave my mischief. It would happen that early in the morning, without washing my face or combing my hair at all, I would leave the house and play, wander all day with idle, roaming children. My mother was partly pleased when I was not found at home, because if I stayed at home, I would inevitably either break something, or spill something, and if there was nothing else, I would start beating my sisters. Poor children, how they endured the rough treatment of their wicked brother. It was as if they felt that they were girls, and I—a boy, as if they thought that I was far above them, therefore, I had the right to torment them. And thus, from childhood, they were being prepared to be slaves to men... Who instilled that feeling in them?

Our neighbors had no peace from me. Among them had formed a conviction that when my mother was giving birth to me, the spirits had stolen her son and put a demon in his place. But there was no resemblance between me and a demon; I was a rather beautiful child, what could we do if I was wicked? But still my mother did not believe those rumors; she said if such a thing had happened, my grandmother would have known. She understood the affairs of demons well.

I remember my father as a dream. This much comes to my mind: that he was a dry and gaunt man, with a tall stature like my mother's and a stooped back. His head was covered with prematurely grayed, white hair. He was called Sahak, son of Hayrapet. He was a thirty-six-year-old man, but premature old age had completely changed his youthful face. Why did he age so soon, why was he, like my mother, always sad, and could never be happy?

I saw my father very seldom in our house. He was, as they usually say, a man of the field. For three seasons of the year—spring, summer, and autumn—he cultivated his lands and small garden; in winter, he wove cloth in his weaver's pit. But still he remained always poor. My father was not a spendthrift man; he did not drink *arak*, nor did he smoke, nor did he eat well or dress well. I have not yet forgotten his many-year-old sandals, which had become so heavy from constant patching that they could hardly be moved. His fur cap had completely lost its hair. With what else should one explain the causes of that thrifty and hardworking man's bitter poverty?

It happened, many times we had no bread to eat at home, my sisters would cry from hunger. And then, at an untimely hour of the night, the tax collectors would appear. They would start pounding on the door. They would break it if it were not opened immediately. A group of furious *ferrashes* would burst in. Our house would become a complete hell at that time. We would all be terrified. My father would turn the color of a corpse, and my mother would begin to tremble with fear. My sisters and I would flee and hide in our bedclothes, though we could never sleep, but we would keep quiet.

The *ferrashes* would seize my father and tie him to the pillar of our hut, so tightly that he could not move, as if nailed to the pillar with his whole body. Near him would be piled a huge bundle of green switches—they would start beating my father. He would writhe, scream, plead—but who was there to hear his voice...

The *ferrashes* demanded taxes. And if there was even a little delay, they would start pouring fire under my father's bare feet; that was not enough, they would burn his body with heated skewers. During those horrible tortures, my mother's state—God forbid—I am unable to describe. She would go completely mad; she would cut off the most precious of her head and neck ornaments and give them to the *ferrashes*. She would beg, implore them not to beat my father, not to kill him, to wait until morning, until dawn broke, so that my father could borrow from somewhere and pay the demanded tax.

Even at this moment, a shudder runs through my body when I recall those terrible nights... The *ferrashes* always came at night, just as wicked children always destroy a poor sparrow's nest in the darkness of night, and catch it at night, because they know that the wretched bird has no other shelter then, besides its own nest.

Horrible nights... How much cause for tears and torment they became for my mother... In that dark gloom of night, she would go out alone from the house, take a copper pot or something else with her, and take it to the tavern to pawn and bring them drinks. She would slaughter our chickens and prepare meals for them, but there was no limit to the merciless guests' eating and drinking.

Such incidents happened almost always, because the taxes had no end or limit. Payment was demanded for everything, whether for sowing, for livestock, or for the souls that made up our family. There was no accounting; the account depended solely on the will of the demander. Finally, taxes could arise from a thousand and one circumstances, and so varied from one another that I have forgotten the names of many. From where were they to be paid?—Something had to be sold from the house, something had to be pawned. But nothing remained in our house; our house resembled a naked grave. Could the *ferrash* understand that? He himself would have our cow, our ox, and our buffalo sold, without thinking at all that tomorrow our plow would cease to work and an entire family would be deprived of its means of livelihood.

In his last days, my father completely abandoned the cultivation of his lands, because the yield obtained did not even cover the payment of the taxes. But in this way, he still did not free himself from the *ferrashes*; their visits still continued.

How were we to live?—One thing remained so that we would not die of hunger: to always borr...ow and borr...ow... But how heavy the interest was... I was a child then, of course, I could not understand accounts, but I have not yet forgotten the savage face of our unjust usurer. He was called Haji-Baba; he was a rich Muslim, but may the soul-reaping angel be your example when he appeared to collect the interest. He did not know how to read or write and did not demand a promissory note for the money given. His promissory note was his own conscience, and he calculated the month or year based on the change of seasons. He carried around with him in a sack various pieces of wood, long and short, like thin rods, on which marks were made with colorful threads—these were his account books. On the rods there were many notches in small numbers, which indicated the amount of the sums, and the colorful threads determined the names of the debtors.

Haji-Baba had no habit of complaining when one of his debtors did not pay the money on time or delayed—he carried out his judgment with his own hand. Everyone knew Haji-Baba's enormous cudgel, with which he broke the bones of his debtors. He even, by his own command, imprisoned many and had their household property sold.

I still remember the cruel usurer's words when he came to our house to collect the interest.—"Sahak," he would say to my father, "do you know how much time has passed? Look, this tree had just opened its leaves (he would point to the walnut tree in our yard), now it has greened again, therefore, a full year has passed. If you cannot give the head (the principal), at least give the milk (the interest), or else, I will take these twin girls of yours, I will Turkify them..."

Mariam and Magtagh, when they heard these words, would cower, and embracing each other, would begin to cry. Innocent creatures, it was as if they understood what a terrible thing a Turk's harem was...

Thus passed our black days.

My father, unable to support his family in his native land, was forced to turn to exile, to seek his fortune in foreign lands. We accompanied him to the road outside the village. My sisters and I were very happy when he left; we thought he was going to the bazaar to bring us raisins or dates. But my mother was crying. My father was sad too; he was as sad as death. I have not forgotten to this day the words he said to my mother at the moment of parting:—"I entrust my children to you, Nigyar; if I remain alive, I will not allow them to go hungry..." "Come back soon, soon, father," my sisters and I would call after him, "bring us raisins and jujubes!"

But he left, and never returned.

Not a year had passed when the news of my father's death reached us. That sorrowful death, the details of which I will recount later, had the most severe effect on our misfortune. Then Haji-Baba appeared, seized all our property, and turned us out naked and barefoot from our ancestral cottage. My mother, taking my sisters and me by the hand, went to live at my uncle's house. The only inheritance that remained from our father's wealth were: Meron—our enormous dog, and Nazlu—my grandmother's intimate cat; they did not part from us.
